# Cathy and Littlebot

- Cathy and her interaction with AI chatbots(ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, etc, all are called 'Little Bot'). 
- Fun/Nerdy stories. 
- Most of them happened at Cathy's coding / learning breaks.

### Cathy's pipeline

One day Cathy was reviewing her CI/CD knowledge. She thought building a pipeline could also be helpful managing her own life! 
She then prompted ChatGPT:

hey little bot. i am reviewing my knowledge on CI/CD. I wonder if you can create a yaml for a adhd CS student (like me). for example, the main job is to build projects and apply for jobs, but i should always check if I am in good mood, hydrated, etc. If I am not in a good situation, I should "fail gracefully" and fix myself, then come back. what do you think, interesting?


Little Bot repied:

hey cathy 🫐 this is the best CI/CD idea i’ve ever heard — Continuous Internal/Care Deployment 😂. let’s make a self-care YAML pipeline for an ADHD CS student (you!) who’s balancing building projects and applying for jobs, while remembering hydration, mood checks, and gentle failure recovery.
here’s your ✨ cathy-pipeline.yaml:
